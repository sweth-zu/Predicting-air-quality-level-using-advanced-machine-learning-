# Predicting-air-quality-level-using-advanced-machine-learning-
Overview of the Air Quality Prediction Code

This script is designed to predict air quality levels using a machine learning approach. It covers the full pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation and feature analysis.


---

Key Components:

1. Data Loading:

Loads air quality data from a CSV file.

Provides an overview of the dataset, including column information and summary statistics.



2. Data Cleaning:

Handles missing values by dropping rows with empty data.

Prepares features (X) and target (y) for model training.



3. Data Splitting:

Divides the data into training and testing sets (80-20 split).



4. Feature Scaling:

Standardizes the features for better model performance using StandardScaler.



5. Model Training:

Uses a RandomForestRegressor for prediction.

Trains the model on the training set.



6. Model Evaluation:

Evaluates the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R^2 Score.



7. Feature Importance Analysis:

Visualizes feature importance to understand the most influential factors in air quality prediction.



8. Model Saving:

Saves the trained model for future use.
